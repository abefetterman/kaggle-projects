# TGS Salt Identification Challenge

[Link to competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tgs-salt-identification-challenge)

Segment 2D earth ultrasound data to identify salt deposits.

## Model and Training

The model used is a SE-UNet with residual blocks. See [unetres.py](./unetres.py) for 
implementation details.

Data augmentation used from [albumentations](https://github.com/albu/albumentations): 
RandomSizedCrop, HorizontalFlip, GridDistortion, RandomContrast, 
RandomBrightness, RandomGamma

Supervised training was done in 3 phases: 
* Initial tuning, pixel-wise BCE loss function
* Fine tuning, Lovasz loss
* Second fine tuning, Lovasz loss with cosine annealing LR

Semi-supervised training was tried as well:
* Variational Adversarial Training plus Entropy Minimization

Additional tricks include using middle data to predict whether the image has no salt at all,
use of hypercolumns and deep supervised training.
